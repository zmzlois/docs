## Deployed Status

When an application reaches the 'Deployed' status, it indicates successful deployment. You can verify this directly within Zephyr Mission Control under the 'Application' section where the status is clearly marked.

## Previewing Versions

Within our browser extension, you can preview all versions of your applications. 

When you select an application under **Name**, you will see your latest deployed application in the browser. You can also preview previously deployed version by clicking on the dropdown menu under **Version**. Rollback and forward to previous/latest deployed version is currently under development. 

## Micro-Frontends & Remotes

In Zephyr Mission Control, you have the ability to manage your micro-frontends and their respective remote versions. Each registered micro-frontend will be listed, and you can control the specific versions that are currently deployed or under development.

### Switching Applications

Zephyr Mission Control allows you to switch between different applications easily. Each application can be selected from a dropdown menu, enabling you to manage multiple projects efficiently.

### Switching Remote Versions

You can also switch between different versions of your remotes. This flexibility supports testing and integration processes by allowing different versions to be deployed in different environments.

## Publishing Updates

When you're ready to update the environment with new changes, you can publish updates directly from Zephyr Mission Control. 

:::warning
By clicking 'Publish updates', you will create a snapshot of the currently used environment, locking in the versions of all remotes being consumed.

In this section we will walk you through what you will need to start using Zephyr and enjoy its benefits by deploying an application through Zephyr and modifying configuration. We will start with installing and creating your account, then create a standalone React app. At the end of this guide, you will have your first [React](https://react.dev/) app deployed to Zephyr with [Rspack](https://rspress.dev/) as bundler and use our [version control](/guide/features/versioning) feature to rollback your application.

If you are curious to read more before about us, you can dive into our [recipes](/#recipes) (for more frameworks and bundlers) and [features](/guide/features). Below guide is written based on Google chrome thus other browser's behavior might differ.

# Get started

In this section we will walk you through what you will need to start using Zephyr and enjoy its benefits by deploying an application through Zephyr and modifying configuration. We will start with installing and creating your account, then create a standalone React app. At the end of this guide, you will have your first [React](https://react.dev/) app deployed to Zephyr with [Rspack](https://rspress.dev/) as bundler and use our [version control](/guide/usage/versioning) feature to rollback your application.

If you are curious to read more before about us, you can dive into our [recipes](/#recipes) (for more frameworks and bundlers) and [features](/guide/usage). Below guide is written based on Google chrome thus other browser's behavior might differ.

:::info
Our chrome extension is only supported on Chromium based browsers. See a list of supported browser [below](#browser-support).
:::

## Installation and setup
#### 1. Install Chrome Extension 

Head to Chrome Web Store to install our chrome extension - [Zephyr Mission Control](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn). Click on **Add to Chrome** and confirm with **Add extension**. After you finish remember to **pin** the extension by clicking on <DrawingPinIcon className="inline -rotate-45"/> on extension management tab to provide you a quicker access to Zephyr's side panel.


#### 2. Log in 

Once you click on <img src="/logo.png" className="inline h-5 w-5 brightness-[3]"/> the side panel will pop up and prompt you to log in (if you are using Microsoft Edge you will need to click on **Open Side Panel**).

<Image src={"/log-in.png"} />

:::details{title="What happens when you log in?"}
While we are loggin you in, we are storing your authorization information locally under `~/.zephyr` in your root directly. Whenever you want to clean up your local profile information (they are JWT claims for each of the project you deployed through Zephyr), you can enter your root directory in terminal and run: 
```sh 
rm rf ~/.zephyr 
```
:::

Now you have created an account and the side panel is empty - hold up! We will get into how to use our dashboard in a bit. Let's deploy an app through Zephyr so you can see a live example of how to use our side panel.

#### 3. Create a react app

:::tip{title="Prerequisites"}
- npm >=10
- node >=20 

If you don't have `nvm` to manage your node version yet, head to [the official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it.
```sh 
nvm use 20 
```
:::


Once the prerequisites are fulfilled, we can follow [Nx guide to create a standalone React app](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-standalone-tutorial):

```sh title="Terminal"
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-first-mf-app --preset=react-standalone
```

The creation process will ask you: 
```sh 
Need to install the following packages:
create-nx-workspace@19.2.2
Ok to proceed? (y) 
```
Press <Keyboard shortcuts={["y", "Enter"]}/> and then choose the following highlighted options.

Choose `Rspack` as bundler option.
```sh  {6}
NX   Let's create a new workspace [https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro]

? Which bundler would you like to use? …
Vite    [ https://vitejs.dev/     ]
Webpack [ https://webpack.js.org/ ]
Rspack  [ https://www.rspack.dev/ ]
```
Choose `None`.
```sh  {5}
✔ Which bundler would you like to use? · rspack
? Test runner to use for end to end (E2E) tests …
Playwright [ https://playwright.dev/ ]
Cypress [ https://www.cypress.io/ ]
None
```
When you are prompted to choose styling solution - choose `Tailwind`.
```sh {5}
? Default stylesheet format …
CSS
SASS(.scss)       [ https://sass-lang.com   ]
LESS              [ https://lesscss.org     ]
tailwind          [ https://tailwindcss.com     ]
styled-components [ https://styled-components.com            ]
emotion           [ https://emotion.sh                       ]
styled-jsx        [ https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-jsx ]
```
Choose `Skip for now` when you are asked to choose CI. 
```sh {5}
? Set up CI with caching, distribution and test deflaking …
(it's free and can be disabled any time)
Yes, for GitHub Actions with Nx Cloud
Yes, for CircleCI with Nx Cloud
Skip for now
```
Choose `Skip for now` when you are asked for remote caching option
```sh {4}
? Would you like remote caching to make your build faster? …
(it's free and can be disabled any time)
Yes
Skip for now
```
You can see the code up to this stage here: <SourceCode href="https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-examples/tree/my-first-mf-app/after/examples/my-first-mf-app" />. If you want to use our examples to try a deployment, remember to **fork** it. 

:::warning{title="Why fork it"}
When you are trying to deploy an application, Zephyr will figure out if you have write_access based on which organization the repository belong to. Thus if you fork it, it will be under your organization and you will be able to deploy.  
:::


#### 4. Adding Zephyr
Open the project folder we created with code editor of your choice. Within current working directory, install Zephyr's plugin by running: 
```sh title="Terminal" 
npm i zephyr-webpack-plugin 
``` 
After install the plugin, open the file `rspack.config.ts` in project root and replace the original configuration as below
```js title="rspack.config.js" 
const { composePlugins, withNx, withReact } = require('@nx/rspack');  // [!code --]
    // [!code --]
module.exports = composePlugins(withNx(), withReact(), (config) => { // [!code --]

```
Now you are all set! Go back to the terminal in current project and run 
```sh title="Terminal" 
nx build
```
You will see the terminal output like so - your deployed URL is before the final emitting process:
```sh title="Terminal" {16-18}
❯ nx build

 NX   Its time to update Nx 🎉

Press <Keyboard shortcuts={["Command"]}/> and left click on the URL at the same time to open your deployed URL in your default browser. Meanwhile **open your side panel** by clicking on <img src="/logo.png" className="inline h-5 w-5 brightness-[3]"/>. Note that this URL is alive as long you don't delete your account and you can share it with anyone to preview it. 

<Image src="/side-panel-1.png"/>

Every application you have deployed on Zephyr (under the same account) will be displayed under **Name**, categorized by repository name and their package name. Click on the dropdown menu under **Version** you will only the initial version of your app. 

<Image src="/my-first-mf-app-1.png" size="large"/>

#### 5. Deploy a new version

Now you have deployed the first version, let's add modify the app and deploy a new version. Open the file `src/app/app.tsx` and change the content of your home page:

```tsx title="src/app/app.tsx"
import NxWelcome from './nx-welcome'; // [!code --]

export function App() { 
  return ( 
    <div> // [!code --]
      <NxWelcome title="my-first-mf-app" /> // [!code --]
    </div> // [!code --]
    <div className="min-w-screen h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-black "> // [!code ++]
      <a // [!code ++]
        href="https://zephyr-cloud.io" // [!code ++]
        target="_blank" // [!code ++]
        rel="noreferrer" // [!code ++]
        className="py-8 px-8 absolute bg-gradient-to-r z-20 w-[400px] flex justify-center rounded-lg from-[#111830] via-sky-950 to-teal-950" // [!code ++]
      > // [!code ++]
        <p className="text-white z-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-wide"> // [!code ++]
          My First App deployed to Zephyr! // [!code ++]
        </p>{' '} // [!code ++]
      </a> // [!code ++]
    </div> // [!code ++]
  ); 
} 

export default App; 

```
If the styling is acting weird let's do a quick fix by serving Tailwind from CDN. 
```html title="src/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>MyFirstMfApp</title>
  <base href="/" />
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script> // [!code ++]
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" />
</head>

<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>

</html>
```

If you run a `nx serve` you will see your app changed to: 

<Image src="/my-first-mf-app-2.png" size="large"/>

Save the file and go back to the terminal to deploy the new version of your application - run:
```sh title="Terminal"
nx build
```

You will see the new version of your app both in the console output and under **Version** dropdown in on Chrome Extension.

```sh title="Terminal" {16-18}

Now the latest version of your app is deployed. You can check the source code till this stage here: <SourceCode href="https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-examples/tree/my-first-mf-app/before/examples/my-first-mf-app" />

:::details{title="Version name"}
The names of your versions are generated by Zephyr. The first part of the name is the branch name, serialised version of your email, followed by the version number.
:::


#### 6. Rollback to previous version 

The first option in the dropdown menu under **Version** is the latest deployment of your app. In the dropdown menu you will see more previous version of your app. 

But if you want to rollback to the previous version of your deployed application, you can click on one of the options and that version will show up in the browser, once you confirm that you want to push it to production you can click on **Publish updates** at the bottom of the side panel. 

<Image src="/side-panel-3.png" />


#### 7. Check your projects on dashboard 

If you want to see all your projects and their versions, sign in on [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) and you will see all your projects and their dependencies.

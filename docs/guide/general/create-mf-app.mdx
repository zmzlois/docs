# Create a module federation app

Developed by [Jack Herrington](https://twitter.com/jherr) , co-author of the "Practical Module Federation" [book](https://module-federation.myshopify.com/products/practical-module-federation) and technology-focused [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/@jherr).

`create-mf-app` is a tool that creates a Module Federation application, API server, or library based on one of multiple different templates.

## Generating Application

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to use the `create-mf-app` tool to create a Module Federation application and integrate it with Zephyr. 

To execute `npm` package binaries, use the `npx` command as follows:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-mf-app
```


Choose a name for your application. Ensure you designate one host and at least one remote, choosing names that reflect their roles accordingly.

```bash
? Pick the name of your app: (host)
```

Select the type of application:

```bash
? Project Type: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Application
  API Server
  Library
```

You may use the default port option:

```bash
? Port number: (8080)
```

We conducted tests using React, but other frameworks may also be compatible. See a list of tested framework [here](/guide/recipes#frameworks)

```bash
? Framework: (Use arrow keys)
lit-html
preact
❯ react
react-esm
solid-js
svelte
vanilla
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

We prefer TypeScript, but Zephyr is compatible with both TypeScript and JavaScript.

```bash 
? Language:
❯ typescript
javascript
```
Both CSS and Tailwind are viable options for styling:

```bash 
? CSS: (Use arrow keys)
❯ CSS
Tailwind
```

While both packing options are viable, we strongly recommend **Rspack** for its performance. See [benchmark of Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/).

```bash 
? Bundler: (Use arrow keys)
Webpack
❯ Rspack
```

## Adding Zephyr to Your Module Federation App

Installing Zephyr plugin:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd create-mf-app-rspack-host
npm install zephyr-webpack-plugin --save
```

### Zephyr Configuration Integration

Incorporate the Zephyr configuration into your existing setup by wrapping the current configuration object with Zephyr's functionality. This enhancement is performed using the `zephyr-webpack-plugin`, as demonstrated below:

```diff filename="rspack.config.js"
module.exports = {/* the existing config object */}; // [!code --]
const { withZephyr } = require('zephyr-webpack-plugin'); // [!code ++]
module.exports = withZephyr()({/* the existing config object */}); // [!code ++]
```

### Setting a Git Origin

1. **Initialize the Git Repository:**

Initialize the Git repository to start tracking your project:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git init
```

2. **Stage Files for Commit:**

Add all files to the staging area in preparation for the initial commit:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git add --all
```

3. **Create an Initial Commit:**

Commit the staged files to your repository with a descriptive message:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git commit -m "Initial commit with Zephyr"
```

4. **Set the Default Branch Name:**

Define 'main' as the default branch for your repository:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git branch -M main
```

5. **Add a Remote Origin:**
Zephyr requires a Git origin to establish a unique project, application, and version combination. Replace `User` and `UserRepo` with your GitHub username and repository name:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git remote add origin https://github.com/User/UserRepo.git
```

6. **Push to GitHub (Optional):**

Optionally, you can push your code to GitHub to store your changes remotely:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git push -u origin main
```

:::info
**Error Handling:**
If you encounter errors due to unset Git configurations, ensure you have set both your Git `user.name` and `user.email`, and that you have a valid 'git remote origin' set up.
```bash 
[ConfigurationError: [zephyr]: git is not configured properly

    - please set git user.name and user.email

    - please set valid 'git remote origin'

]
```
If this error show up - create a new repository and copy the link to that repository, do: 
```bash filename="Terminal"
git remote add origin git@github.com:User/UserRepo.git
```
:::

## Using Zephyr

Zephyr operates as a side effect of the build process, allowing you to execute the build in watch mode for continuous updates.

:::info
Please note that until Alpha 1 is released to production, you will need to operate within our development environment using the following environment variable:
:::

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm run build --watch
```

:::info
The first time you initiate a build with Zephyr, it will prompt you to log in by directing you to the Zephyr website. This login is required only on your first build; subsequent builds will not require a login.
:::

### Understanding Build Outputs

During the build process, three distinct URIs are generated as follows:

1. An individual snapshot of the build.
2. The current tag.
3. The current environment.

For a detailed explanation of these outputs, please refer to our [versioning documentation](/guide/usage/versioning).

```bash filename="terminal"

```

Please note that the live reload functionality on remotes is currently unavailable and will be addressed shortly.

## Next Steps

You can now proceed to add remotes and start building your federated application as planned.
